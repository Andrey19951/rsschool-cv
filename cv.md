<h3>Contacts</h3>
<p>I'm young, spirited person striving to achieve new knowledge and experience. Right now i focus on front-end development. I found this area very excited and it seems I'm ready to spend a lot of free time sitting at the computer and coding something. First of all, I like the process, it is really amazing when you do something and immediately have opportunity to see the result. I really hope and do on my best in order to knowledges obtaining on this course will be useful as for me as for my prospective employer.</p>

<p><b>Work Experience</b></p>
<p>I don't have work experience in the Front end development. In present, I work for EPAM systems as LMS administrator. In my work I closely relate with HTML and CSS, rarely with JS. Having worked with these languages I have a desire to develop my skills in this area. In my turn, I understand how big is the area of web development and that it requires a lot of time for me to became a good specialist. But I'm ready to this challenge and confident that all efforts will pay off.</p>
